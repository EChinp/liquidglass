> People mocking Appleâ€™s new liquid glass clearly donâ€™t understand what theyâ€™re looking at. Glass is one of the hardest materials to render cleanly without visual noise - pulling it off this well is a huge technical flex. And no, Vista wasnâ€™t even close. If youâ€™re comparing this to Vista, youâ€™re either blind or just repeating what others say without thinking. Same crowd, same noise - noobs. ðŸ˜„

> This is Liquid Glass â€” Appleâ€™s another technological feat. And if you are comparing it with Vista, either you have forgotten about Windows Vista or you are just shouting in the void.
> Glass is the toughest thing to render. EVER. Apple has done a beyond marvelous job in creating this. Kudos.
